Have you ever wanted to simulate the day to day lives of those lonesome creatures lurking in our nearly bottomless oceans? 
Now you can! And it turns out it involves constantly eating or being eaten!

Read the character descripts and choose the fish which best suits you and take on the other challengers. But be careful, they bite back. Made with JS and JQuery.
